COMPLETE GUIDE TO SAVING AND UNDOING CHANGES

=================== PART 1: SAVING YOUR CHANGES ===================

(Do this whenever your changes are working well)

STEP 1: Open PowerShell

- Press Windows + X
- Click "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal"

STEP 2: Go to your project folder

- Copy and paste this EXACT command (including the quotes):

cd "E:\PT\01 - Billion Hopes - Logo + Logo Gifs + fiver project files + Intro work\23 - Billion Hopes - Website\CURSOR website1"

STEP 3: Check what files changed
- Type: git status
- You'll see red files = files that have changes

STEP 4: Save all changes
- Type: git add .
- Type: git status
- You'll now see green files = files ready to be saved

STEP 5: Create the save point
- Type: git commit -m "Everything is working - saving this version"
- This creates your save point that you can return to later

=================== PART 2: UNDOING CHANGES ===================

(Do this when you want to go back to your last save)

STEP 1: Open PowerShell

- Press Windows + X
- Click "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal"

STEP 2: Go to your project folder

- Copy and paste this EXACT command (including the quotes):
cd "E:\PT\01 - Billion Hopes - Logo + Logo Gifs + fiver project files + Intro work\23 - Billion Hopes - Website\CURSOR website1"

STEP 3: Undo all changes
- Type: git checkout -- .
- This will undo everything back to your last save point

=================== IMPORTANT TIPS ===================

WHEN TO SAVE (COMMIT):
- After making changes that work well
- Before making big changes
- When everything is running correctly

WHEN TO UNDO (CHECKOUT):
- When something breaks
- When you don't like your recent changes
- When you want to start over from your last save

REMEMBER:
- You can only go back to your last save point
- Always test your changes before saving
- Save (commit) frequently when things are working
- If you close Cursor without saving, you might lose the ability to undo

Think of it like a video game:
- git commit = Creating a save point in your game
- git checkout = Loading your last save point
- You can only load saves that you actually made!

Need help? Just follow these steps exactly as written.
Remember: The command to undo is: git checkout -- .
